Hospital Management System (Offline Android App)
This is a basic **Hospital Management System** Android app that I built as a **practice project** to improve my Java and Android development skills. The app works **completely offline** and does not use Firebase or any internet connection.

What the App Does
- Adds patient details like name, age, issue, and emergency level
- Schedules appointments using **priority queue** (emergency-based)
- Shows all patient records in a list
- Saves data using local storage (no cloud/Firebase)

Screens/Activities
- MainActivity: Shows list of patients
- AddPatientActivity: Form to add a new patient
- AppointmentScheduler: Arranges appointments based on emergency level

How to Run the App
-Open the project in **Android Studio**
-Wait for **Gradle sync** to complete
-Click **Run** or press `Shift + F10`
-App will open in your emulator or Android phone

How to Create APK (Optional)
-In Android Studio go to:  
   `Build > Generate Signed APK`
-Follow the steps and install the `.apk` on any phone

What I Learned
- How to build Android UI using XML
- How to use **Java classes**, objects, and logic
- Working with **Lists**, **Adapters**, and **PriorityQueue**
- Handling user input and displaying data in Android
